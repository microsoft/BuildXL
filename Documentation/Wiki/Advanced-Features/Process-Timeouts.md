# BuildXL process timeouts

## Process timeouts

Process pips launched by BuildXL have configurable timeouts.
The overall timeout will cause a pip to be terminated and considered a failure if exceeded.
There is also a warning timeout that will be printed as a hint to users, to indicate that they are reaching a time limit.

There are a few ways the timeouts are set:

* A default timeout that applies to all pips. This defaults to 10 minutes if not specified, but can be overridden on the command line.

  * `/pipDefaultTimeout:<string>` - How long to wait before terminating individual processes. The argument allows an expression that represents a time duration, like "3s", "500ms", "30m", "1.5h". The allowed suffixes are 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h', and no suffix is interpreted as an amount in milliseconds. Setting this value will only have an effect if no other timeout is specified.

  * `/pipDefaultWarningTimeout:<string>` - After how much time to issue a warning that an individual process ran too long. The argument allows an expression that represents a time duration, like "3s", "500ms", "30m", "1.5h". The allowed suffixes are 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h', and no suffix is interpreted as an amount in milliseconds. Setting this value will only have an effect if no other timeout is specified for a process.

* Per-process timeouts are configurable at graph construction time. These override the global timeout. These are the fields on the Transformer.Execute API:
   ```ts
   /**
     * Provides a hard timeout after which the Process will be marked as failure due to timeout and terminated.
     */
   timeoutInMilliseconds?: number;

   /**
    * Sets an interval value that indicates after which time BuildXL will issue a warning that the process is running longer
    * than anticipated
    */
   warningTimeoutInMilliseconds?: number;
   ```
   (see the `Transformer.execute` documentation for more details)

* A timeout multiplier on the commandline, which defaults to 1. If set, the timeout from the rules above will be multiplied by this value to get the effective timeout.

  * `/pipTimeoutMultiplier:<float>` - Multiplier applied to the final timeout for individual processes. Setting a multiplier greater than one will increase the timeout accordingly for all pips, even those with an explicit non-default timeout set.
  * `/pipWarningTimeoutMultiplier:<float>` - Multiplier applied to the warning timeout for individual processes. Setting a multiplier greater than one will increase the warning timeout accordingly for all pips, even those with an explicit non-default warning timeout set (see command line help text).

The following happens when the timeout is reached:
* The job object for the process is enumerated and a heap dump is taken for all currently running processes in the tree.
* The job object is killed, terminating all processes
* The process pip is marked as a failure, preventing all downstream pips from being run. The location of these dump files will appear in the error message regarding the timeout.

To aid in discovering when pips are at the brink of the failure threshold, there is a second warning threshold that can be configured at a global and per-pip level similar to what is described above.

## Process injection timeouts
There is also a "process injection" timeout. This is the amount of time BuildXL allows for spawning a process and the process sandboxing injecting itself into the running process. Generally this happens on the order of milliseconds, but on a very heavily loaded computer it may take much longer. The timeout for this is set to 10 minutes but this timeout is not user configurable.

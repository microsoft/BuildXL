# JavaScript coordinator options

Currently BuildXL natively supports the following JavaScript coordinators: [Rush](https://rushjs.io/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (on workspaces), [Lage](https://github.com/microsoft/lage) and [Nx](https://nx.dev/). More coordinators may be added in the future.

Even though the vast majority of the configuration options equally apply to all, there are some differences you can check here:

* [Rush](js-rush-options.md) specific options
* [Yarn](js-yarn-options.md) specific options
* [Lage](js-lage-options.md) specific options
* [Nx](js-nx-options.md) specific options

Does your repository build in a custom way or use a coordinator not listed here? [Check](js-custom-graph.md) how to customize it.
